# What is this place?
I figure for the first post on this site I should explain what it is exactly. nyah.dev is a place for me to share cool things I am doing, or things that I am interested in.
Currently, the only cool thing on the site is my Game Boy emulator named <Link target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="SubColor underline" href="/GMu">GMu.</Link> There is even
a demo embedded in the page, thanks to the convenience of Emscripten, WASM, and SDL! Hopefully in the near future I will have some cool stuff to share here, but for now, I will keep
my plans a secret since speaking them could mean they wont happen ;).

# The web...
After spending the better part of this month developing this site, I don't really think web dev is all that bad. Though, everything I have heard about making web based software made it sound rather 
un-interesting. When making web programs, you usually download quite a number of libraries. For this simple website, I think I had to install about 300 ish. I decided to use Next.js which no doubt
contributed to the large number of packages. 

For many, programming with libraries is par for the course, but I always find it far less interesting when I start using a library rather than implementing the feature my self. The main reason for this is 
that I struggle to understand how to use the library, because I don't know how to it works. After programming a lot more, I do find using libraries to be easier, but when you run into issues you are at mercy
of the internet to find out what the heck happened. 

Overall though, it was not that bad of an experience. The worst thing by far was CSS, but I managed to squeak by in the end. At some point I will probably redesign the site to look a bit cooler, but I am happy
with the result so far.

# Going forward
I plan to write about really anything that comes to mind, so chances are the next post will probably be gaming related. I have been playing through Persona 3 Reload, and plan on starting S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl soon.

To leave off, here is a picture of a parfait from a vending machine that I ate in Japan. It was surprisingly good, and looked pretty neat!
