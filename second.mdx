Now for a bit of clarity!
# This is a heading 1!
## This is a heading 2!
### This is a heading 3!

Now just some text!

```js
    export const function testFunction() {
        const text = "Hello World!";
        console.log(text);
    }
```

Just put some sample **JS** code!

- A list!
- Second element!

1. Ordered
2. List
3. Goes
4. Here!

Becuase we are hosting on GitHub, we can easily update things and even change the date!
