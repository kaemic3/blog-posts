Here is another test article so I can see if ondemand re-validation is working!

# Some random facts about me:
- My favorite video game is Fallout: New Vegas.
- Kingdom is the best manga ever IMO.
- i'mperfect is the best LTS album IMO.
- My favorite programming language is C with a C++ compiler.
- Webdev stuff has been pretty fun! But I will admit it has been interesting getting used to working so much with code I did not write!
- Persona 3 Reload releases soon, and I am pretty excited for it!

## Other stuff:
- I want to try and get my GameBoy emulator, GMu running on this site. I plan on using WebAssembly to get it going, so good luck me!
- I really want to try and create a GUI based program, like say a markdown editor using Dear IM GUI. I feel like that could be a good way to learn some OpenGL stuff!
- At some point, I will be working on my game engine again. Everything I know is from handmade hero, so thanks Casey!
    - Also, I think Casey should try doing some webdev stuff and give his honest thoughts. I do feel like him and JBlow are a bit harsh on the web peeps.
- At some point, I would like to look into doing some software ports to the Nintendo Switch, 3DS, and PSVita. 
- I also really want to try making a New Vegas script extender mod at somepoint.
- Oh and I really want to make a survival game that is inspired by Unturned/7 Days to Die.

There, some random things on my mind on a Tuesday evening :3
