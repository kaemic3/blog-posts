Here are some random notes I took at the beginning of this website project!

## Random terms that I should know!
#### DOM - Document Object Model:
- Interface for web documents. 
- Can be modified with a scripting language.
#### Shallow copy:
- Object where the properties share references as the source. This means that changing one can change both!
#### Array.prototype.filter():
- Can pass an arrow function that will evaluate each item in the list under a certain condition, then returns a shallow copy with the portion that meets the test.
#### Template literals:
- Delimited with backtick `` ` `` allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged templates.
	- I think these allow for formatting strings easily.
	- `string text ${expression} string text`
#### Object literals:	
- Store collections of data and represent complex structures. Written in the form of key value pairs.
```js
const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  address: '123 Main Street',
  greet: function() {
    console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
  }
};
```
#### Rest and spread operators:
##### Rest: 
- Represented by ..., this can be used like so:
```js
// Use rest to enclose the rest of specific user-supplied values into an array:
function myBio(firstName, lastName, ...otherInfo) { 
  return otherInfo;
}

// Invoke myBio function while passing five arguments to its parameters:
myBio("Oluwatobi", "Sofela", "CodeSweetly", "Web Developer", "Male");

// The invocation above will return:
["CodeSweetly", "Web Developer", "Male"]
```
- Works similarly to the variadic function parameter in C, it looks like.
##### Spread: 
- Also represented by ..., will split an array into individual arguments.
```js
// Use rest to enclose the rest of specific user-supplied values into an array:
function myBio(firstName, lastName, ...otherInfo) { 
  return otherInfo;
}

// Invoke myBio function while passing five arguments to its parameters:
myBio("Oluwatobi", "Sofela", "CodeSweetly", "Web Developer", "Male");

// The invocation above will return:
["CodeSweetly", "Web Developer", "Male"]
```
#### Destructuring assignment:
- Allows for unpacking values from arrays or properties into distinct variables.
```js
[a, b, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

console.log(rest);
// Expected output: Array [30, 40, 50]
```
- Also can "truncate" values in a situation like this:
```js
let x = [10, 20, 30];
[y, z] = x;
// Y = 10, Z = 20
```
# Basics:
- React is declarative, tell it what you want and it will build it.
- React updates rendering and components.
- React native for mobile.
- Need to know 'this', filter, map, and reduce.
## 1/23/24:
- From what I can tell, React just allows you to take a base HTML file, and add to it with "components" as they are called, via scripting instead of working directly in the HTML. You can then have a root App component that gets called in the main file where the root component is added to the default index html file, and then from App, call your component functions and return from there to generate the page!

Here we are at the one week mark!
