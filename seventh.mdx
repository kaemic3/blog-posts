I used to consider myself an avid video game enjoyer. These days I feel guilty even playing a mere couple of hours a week, something my past self would not even consider a proper play session. I think part of the problem is that I am older with more responsibilities now, but I know plenty of people who have full time jobs and still make time to play the newest titles. Do I even like video games anymore?

## What changed?
Many things, naturally. The world does not stop moving forward, and video games are no exception. It is tough to find a modern, popular game that does not compromise in some aspect. For example, the new Yakuza game. Many reviews are positive, but with the caveat that the game has locked new game plus behind a pay wall. Obviously that is not a good thing, and allowing this type of behavior to continue could have negative outcomes.

I have been thinking, is it possible for modern, triple A titles to ever be good again? I think the odds are slim to none. 

## So what now?
Many people speak highly of indie games. As someone who is interested in video game development, I have surprisingly never really played any indie games. I think I will try to change that.
