# So it begins...
I set out to make this website with the goal of learning a bit of React. I plan on posting whatever here, but it will most likely be programming for the most part.
Speaking of which, I am getting ready to start working on a game engine again. Late last year I decided to watch the first about 30 ish videos in the handmade hero series by Casey Muratori.
Most of what was covered was Windows platform specific code, like getting a back buffer to draw to, setting up audio, fixed time step, etc. I am not 100% sure how much more I will watch,
as the game I want to make is quite different to the one Casey is making in his series, but I do know that there is still a whole lot for me to learn.

The idea of making a game engine from complete scratch used to fill me with anticipation, but after a few months of working with stone knives and bear skins,
I am feeling a bit exhausted. Especially after working with React, and JavaScript, where there are so many built in utilities
that speed development up exponentially. However, I have felt first hand the downside of having such extensive features. Honestly,
the inner workings of JavaScript are a true mystery to me. This can lead to session of programming where I exclusively look at articles
online for hours on end to see if I can figure out what the heck I'm doing.

So the plan is still a go. So far in my game engine journey, I limited my self to using few external libraries in my code. The exceptions of course are
SDL, the C and C++ standard libraries, and a couple of the STB libraries. Years ago I tried to make a game in Unreal Engine, and failed due to feeling 
overwhelmed by all of the tools available. And though there a many resources available for developing games with Unreal, it is still a goliath.
Making everything from scratch is a somewhat excessive if the main goal is to make a game, but I am hoping that building everything from the ground up
will provide experience that will make adding features to the tools I use much easier. 

# Mods
Modding support is something I always appreciate. My favorite game, Fallout: New Vegas has some of the best community mods for any Bethesda title. The community
has taken an unstable mess and managed to make it stable enough to play for hours on end, making you forget that stability was even a problem. New Vegas bounties 
is a classic quest mod that has added dozens of hours of playtime to an already complete game. And one of the best mods of all time, a Tale of Two Wastelands 
lets you play Fallout 3 and New Vegas in the same game save. Mods can create value for games years after their launch date, and many popular game series started off as mods, like
Counter Strike and Dota.

Something that goes even beyond making a moddable game, would be to fully open source it. The most prominent example of this would be Doom and Quake. Doom mods are still made to this day,
and entire engine overhauls transform these games, bringing them to the 21st century. These of course are products of the source code being fully available for anyone to poke and prod
at.

Anyway, this concludes the first post. I have been playing through Persona 3 Reload so I may post about that at some point :3
